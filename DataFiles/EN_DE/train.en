For far too long now , we as the European Union have taken measures , for example against Serbia , measures which were necessary but which were taken at no cost whatsoever to ourselves .

We need answers on this score , too .

Immigration is a reality which has already had an impact on the European agenda ; this impact will become even greater as it affects certain very sensitive aspects of our project .
We therefore demand that information on them be made accessible to the public on a regular basis .
Obviously the presidency will have to make its own comments when it gets the opportunity .
To face this new threat , we need to harmonise legislation , boost law enforcement and strengthen cooperation in police work .

We all know that a common European defence would cost a fair amount of money .
If they are unable to do so , they are asked to apply the least favourable rating to offer themselves the greatest protection .

The European Union is consistent in its claims to promote competition and competitiveness , yet it is just as consistent in failing to do so .
Furthermore , on your own initiative , Madam President , a special mention will be given to Mrs Sedrine , the Tunisian journalist .

Thank you , Commissioner , not only for your response but also your comments in relation to Marian Harkin &apos;s words on food security .
I believe our rapporteurs have done well in the circumstances and deserve our thanks .
Thirdly , in the aftermath of an incident , it is obviously only right and proper that we should be able to inform the relatives of the latest circumstances that prevail .
But it is not exclusively to defend our social model , as is legitimate and our duty , that the European Union must demand that human rights are universally respected .

On trade , we are forced to be optimistic and constructive and to push for Europe to stay on a line of progressive constructivity from the WTO meeting in Cancún and the Doha development round .
I support the Commission &apos;s action plan for healthcare in Europe , which would genuinely guarantee people &apos;s safe freedom of movement .
I hope Mrs Ahern will reconsider what she has said .
Therefore we support the Chichester amendment in principle and will be voting in favour of it .
In this matter we need to find the right sort of balance .

Such are the policies and actions that European citizens expect of us , and I hope the regulation on the European Solidarity Fund will be adopted without delay .

Nonetheless , the principle that inspired the Latin phrase is still relevant today .
Ladies and gentlemen , I feel that the credibility of this Intergovernmental Conference method is on the line for the last time .
The EU established that gross human rights violations are still taking place .

There is always a duty to act , however , when individual suffering occurs .
Members will be aware that current Community law in this area resides primarily in four directives that deal with the transportation of dangerous goods .
These aspects are present in some form or other in all the countries concerned but not with equal intensity and we will have to focus the priorities in each country .
