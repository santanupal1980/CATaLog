In France , she has proven that she understands the economy , that she also promotes small and medium-sized enterprises , in particular , and that she has regard for those who actually work and make a contribution .

We have failed to defend them in the past .

Mr President , I hope that this Parliament and the groups which , based on their own convictions , can muster a better position , will take a clearer stance in this respect .
I see no argument whatsoever in the Treaty of Lisbon for having special treatment for comitology when it concerns trade , and we will not agree to that .
I think we have not yet reached this stage , nor even the stage where we might be able to monitor discrimination in each and every Member State , or to take appropriate steps against it .

The work must therefore continue and , in the present situation , the directive ought not to be changed or reviewed .
The EU must revise its democracy and human rights support policy so as to create an implementation mechanism for the human rights clause in all agreements with third countries .

The rapporteur has swept that compromise off the table , however .
I am sorry to tell you that this is not the case today .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - ( NL ) Mr President , this House champions civil liberties , one of which is freedom of education .
What is really needed is a different type of process , in other words , holding binding referendums on the same day throughout the Union in order to ensure that Europe has a different , more progressive draft Constitution .
The Commission proposes to reinforce Member States &apos; compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact , deepen fiscal policy coordination , set minimum requirements for fiscal frameworks and specify the mechanisms for enforcing the current rules .
Issues of such importance should not be decided in such a kamikaze manner .
Mr President , Commissioners you will be beginning to find our speeches repetitive .
( SV ) Madam President , Commissioner Verheugen , as you said , this package was much talked about even before it was tabled .
But breaking with the past and reverting to the rule of law take guts and grit , so I congratulate the new President .

This was what led us to put environmental issues under the heading of solidarity , in terms of presentation .
Subject : Women &apos;s access to the armed forces and sexual harassment
This is with good reason , for we can often lend these countries real support with our aid and resources to local NGOs , civil society and the different media involved .
This debate and the decision we are about to take should reflect this fact .
Madam President , the Common Fisheries Policy is without doubt the most important instrument for making sure that we have sustainable fish stocks throughout European Union waters .
Connected with this – and this is something else we debated frankly , without public disagreement – there is the requirement that there should be no protectionism in a relatively small market like Europe .
In other words , Mr President , we must remain true to our principles : we cannot countenance violations of the principles and fundamental rights on which we base European integration .
It must also make it its business to see that the relevant regulations are complied with .
In addition , aid is being provided to the European Humanities University , which is currently in exile in Vilnius and will continue its activities there for as long as the University is unable to return to Belarus .

Services are not like goods because trade in them often very directly involves human endeavour and not just the virtual trading of a technology .
Just as justified is the section in the report that warns against individuals and groups who want to silence others by claiming that they are being permanently attacked , undeservedly so .
It should also be solved in a way that is in the interests of the local authorities , the small towns and cities , some of which are overwhelmed by the integration work required of them .
Our philosophy is the complete opposite .
There are a few problem areas which I should like to highlight .
Mr Schnellhardt made a few comments on this question that are worth considering .
There has been a lot of focus on IRELA , the Institute for European-Latin American Relations that has now been closed down .
My group considers that it is high time to put a stop to that insidious process of detailed negotiations and to make a gesture towards South Africa .
It did this despite difficult conditions - the political situation at home is not exactly easy , of course , the Treaty of Lisbon is new and even the relationship with the European Council is not all that easy .
This would give us a joint labelling scheme , not only with the USA but also , indirectly , with Japan and some other countries .
This will require greater effort in terms of organising proceedings , both by myself and my fellow Members , but it will show the public a greater commitment to avoiding the senseless waste of public money .

Based on this element , I am calling on the European Commission to bear in mind three points when it comes to providing financial support for the ERI :
This is what needs to be changed , Mr Füle .

( SK ) The international community is facing an extremely important task .
With this legislative instrument we will be able to make progress , not only from a trade perspective but , I hope , from a political and cultural perspective too .

It is up to the Member States to identify programmes and projects to be financed which adhere to the legislation in force .
Industry interests play a part here as well , and we hope that Parliament will agree the amendment wishes of the Committee , as this is a matter of consumer protection .
Does that not cause them stress of a kind which creates a conflict for us when it comes to caring for animals and our ambition to treat animals well ?
We also have a tragic surplus of labour in the form of people who are unemployed .
However , we need an EU-wide solution - not 27 different EU solutions - and we need an international solution too .
The European Union must play its own autonomous role , make its own analysis of the security situation and proceed with its own analysis of the role and composition of and prospects for the multinational force .

Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I too would like to congratulate Mr Barroso on the report he has given us this morning .
It would be useful if the various national authorities monitoring cross-compliance and their various sections would harmonise their efforts to ensure that farmers are not subjected in short succession to several different kinds of inspection .

Parliament ensured that 60 % of staff are to come from other European institutions , which will ensure a certain degree of independence from Member States .

It will be a crucial factor in the success of the strategy .
That has had no impact on the trade unions , who are continuing to spread untruths and panic .
My first comment is that this report deals with a serious matter . Firstly because the charges are serious , and secondly because this relates to the freedom of individuals and the freedom of Members of Parliament .

It is going even further , in that it is redoubling its efforts and is exporting this activity to the territories of democratic Western nations .

We cannot , nor do we wish to , yield to pressure from the United States .
